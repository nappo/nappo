Create a custom core component
==============================

We encourage users to create their own Nappo components to extend current functionality and explore new ideas. To do it, we provide a Python superclass template for each agent component type: Actor, Storage and Algo.

- :ref:`Algo Template`
- :ref:`Actor Template`
- :ref:`Storage Template`

Templates contain detailed information about the abstract methods that need to be implemented by any component subclass. Complementary, already implemented components can also serve as a good starting point to create new ones without coding all abstract class methods
